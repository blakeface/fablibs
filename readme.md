We feel like this project went easier than expected.

The navigating git was much harder than we expected. Most of our hold-ups occurred from git-merges.

Pick a random word from each word table was easier than expected. Also the log-in functions were easier than previously assumed.

We paired like a boss. And we merged frequently, though occasionally those merges would fail.

We all contributed to the .css file and that was a little overwhelming.

We would increase our git fluency. We would also alternate pairs.

Git made it more difficult to collaborate with one-another - primarily because we we're as fluent as we would have liked to have been.

We learned a decent amount of the Bcrypt middleware and authorization. We also master chaining knex queries.

We killed it at communicating and sticking to our responsibilities. We also had eyes on the prize the entire hack-a-thon, so we didn't loose sight or get distracted.

We could have improved on our use of cookies. We also repeated ourselves - it could have been DRY-er.

Our project scope didn't change, which is why we killed it.
